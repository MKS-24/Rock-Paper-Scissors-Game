# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
A simple web app for the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with Streamlit and Python. Players select their move using radio buttons, while the computer randomly chooses its own. When the “Play” button is clicked, both choices are shown, and the app determines and displays the winner or a draw.
